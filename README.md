Poseidon package for the c1global1nfd_public dataset originally compiled for [Peter, Petkova \& Novembre 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz280), and then published with [Shastry, Musiani \& Novembre 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.10.637386).

With 19,954 SNPs for 4,070 modern human individuals and 336 populations from Afro-Eurasia this dataset is a great resource for (superficial) large scale analysis of population structure. It will certainly also work well as a training dataset.
